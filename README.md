This is a grab-bag of various web proposals, both HTML and CSS.

## IMG `basename` attribute

The IMG `basename` attribute is an attribute specified on the IMG element,
which allows the developer to assist the User Agent in specifying the name of
this image. This is used when the User Agent allows the user to download the
image, either via "Save Image" dialog option or drag-and-dropping it into a
directory on the machine.
